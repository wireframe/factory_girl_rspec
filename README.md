# factory_girl_rspec

Integrate FactoryGirl fixture initialization into the RSpec DSL.

## Usage

Basic usage:

```ruby
# spec/models/user_spec.rb
describe User do
  context 'when basic user' do
    # instantiate FactoryGirl :user factory
    with :user
    it { should be_inactive }
    it { should_not be_happy }
    it 'has a first name' do
    	user.first_name.should_not be_nil
    end 
  end
  
  context 'when invalid user' do
  	# instantiate FactoryGirl :invalid_user factory
  	build :invalid_user
    it { should be_invalid }
    its(:first_name) { should be_nil }
  end
end
```

By default, `factory_girl_rspec` uses `FactoryGirl.create` to make objects while saving them to the database. 
This will throw exceptions if the validations aren't passed.
If you would like to explicitly test invalid objects, you can use the `build` method.

Advanced usage:

```ruby
# spec/models/user_spec.rb
describe User do
  context 'when user.first_name == nil' do
    # instantiate FactoryGirl :user factory with custom options
    with :user, :first_name => nil
    it { should be_inactive }
    it { should_not be_happy }
    
    # create FactoryGirl :user factory with custom options
    # you can also pass in a block to any factory_girl_rspec methods, like with FactoryGirl 
    with :user, :first_name => "Ryan" do |user|
  	  user.posts.create(attributes_for(:post))
	end
	its(:first_name) { should eq("Ryan") }
  end
end
```
